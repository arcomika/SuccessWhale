Thank you for downloading SuccessWhale, a Twitter client written in
PHP and MySQL.  This software is free as in beer (i.e. I ask for no
money in exchange for it) and free as in speech (it is licenced
under the GNU GPL v3 - see LICENCE.TXT for details).

If you use this software on your own website, I'd appreciate a link
back to me, though it's by no means essential.  If you've got any
questions or feature requests, I'd love to hear from you - I'm
@tsuki_chama on Twitter.

You will always be able to find the latest version of SuccessWhale
as a free download from:

       http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/successwhale

This page will also contain the latest information and feature list
for the software.

A canonical version of SuccessWhale is available at:

                  http://www.successwhale.com

It is free for anyone to use, if you would like to try out
SuccessWhale before deploying your own version.  If you'd like to
put your newly-downloaded copy of SuccessWhale somewhere on your
part of the Internet, instructions can be found in the INSTALL.TXT
file included with this ZIP.

Thank you for using my software!
