HOW TO INSTALL SUCCESSWHALE
---------------------------

To run your own copy of SuccessWhale, unpack the ZIP file on a web
server that supports PHP and, optionally, MySQL. Edit config.php
with your own settings.

As explained in config.php, you’ll need a Consumer Key and Consumer
Secret – you’ll get those when you register your app with Twitter.
Optionally, you can also enter details for a MySQL database. If you
use a database, the app will remember users’ column setup, will
cache expanded links (speeding up loads somewhat), and will allow
users to cache their authentication tokens if they wish. The app will
create the tables for you when you visit index.php for the first time.
If you don’t want to use a database, just leave “DB_SERVER” blank.

Then just navigate to index.php, log in with Twitter, and you should
be up and running!

Please see the file README.TXT for more information.
