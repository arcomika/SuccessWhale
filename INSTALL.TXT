HOW TO INSTALL SUCCESSWHALE
---------------------------

To run your own copy of SuccessWhale, unpack the ZIP file or clone the github
repository onto a web server that supports PHP and, MySQL.  Once complete, edit
config.php with your own settings.

As explained in config.php, you'll need a variety of bits of information to get
SuccessWhale up and running.

Each service that SuccessWhale supports has a "x_ENABLED" parameter that sets
whether or not SuccessWhale expects to use it.  You'll need to enable at least
one core service (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) to make your SuccessWhale clone
useful.  As well as setting ENABLED to true, enter the other required
information (this will be given to you when you register your new app with
Twitter/Facebook/whatever).

You must also enter details for a MySQL database. The database will be used to
remember usersâ€™ configured accounts and column setup, will cache expanded links
(speeding up loads somewhat), and will allow users to cache their authentication
tokens (for example, users will be able to log in with a SuccessWhale password
and have SuccessWhale manage their authentication with Twitter and Facebook.) The
app will create DB tables for you when you visit index.php for the first time.

Google Analytics is also supported, and you can enter your ID in config.php.

The final setting is DEBUG - enable this to get printouts of various errors you
may encounter when setting up the software, but remember to disable it again
before going live.

Once config.php is set up just navigate to index.php, log in with your service
of choice, and you should be up and running!

Please see the file README.md for more information.
